{"name":"SSN PROV","tagline":"SSNO and PROV-O Together At Last","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis is the page for the SSN-PROV ontology, an alignment betweent the [W3C Semantic Sensor Network](http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/ssn/) (SSN) ontology [SSNO](http://purl.oclc.org/NET/ssnx/ssn ) and the [W3C Provenance Working Group](http://www.w3.org/2011/prov/wiki/Main_Page) [PROV-O](http://www.w3.org/ns/prov-o) ontogies.  The alignment extends the expressive capability of the SSNO for recording observations and system deployments, enabling more comprehensive historical information to be described than is possible using SSNO alone.\r\n\r\nFor further details about the design of the ontology, please see\r\n\r\nCompton, M. and Corsar, D. and Taylor, K.
